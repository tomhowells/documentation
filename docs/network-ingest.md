Argyle Network Ingest is a software platform that leverages L4-L7 Deep Packet Inspection to collect in real-time the information embedded in traffic flows. The solution leverages passive probes and/or port mirroring (SPAN) to capture packets traveling through a network at 10Gbps-100Gbps containing valuable communication signals between applications, devices, sensors and users. 

### Key Features
